# Hello-World
A repository for practicing the github workflow

Written by Mike Lawrence, a senior at Baylor University in Waco, Texas as he gets up to scratch on the workflow for undergraduate research on IRKSOME (https://github.com/firedrakeproject/Irksome). 

Future repositories will include code from CUNY Baruch's Pre-MFE C++, AC-FE, and NLA seminar's, as well as code created while studying under Dr. Daniel Duffy.
